# Time
The function uses Merge Sort algorithm to sort the array which runs at O(n log n). The logic in rearrange_digits function runs at O(n), so overall the function runs at O(n log n).

# Space
Space is O(n) because at each step we were copying values into new arrays, and we were getting rid of the old arrays.
